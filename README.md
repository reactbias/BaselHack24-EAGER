## üì¢ Project Pitch

**Concept:**  
Develop a **media summarization tool** accessible through a **Telegram Bot**, **Chrome Extension**, and **Web App**. Building on the [YouTube Summary with ChatGPT project](https://github.com/kazuki-sf/YouTube_Summary_with_ChatGPT), our approach enhances user control, scalability, and cross-platform accessibility.

**Key Features:**
1. **Claude-Powered Summaries**: Fast, accurate, and cost-effective.
2. **Chrome Extension**: Direct access to summaries on YouTube for seamless use.
3. **Telegram Bot**: Quick, link-based summaries optimized for mobile.
4. **User API Key Support**: Personalized API management for scalability.

**Bonus Vision:**  
A modular API structure to allow multiple AI models (e.g., Claude, GPT) to be integrated, giving users the flexibility to choose or swap models.

**Objective:** Build a high-impact, cross-platform media summarizer balancing feasibility with innovation for a smooth user experience.

## üéØ Mission: Media Summary Suite

An efficient, accessible media summarizer offering real-time, concise summaries across multiple platforms, focused on simplicity and user control.
